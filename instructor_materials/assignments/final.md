# Web 2 Final

Due June 9, 2022 9:30 AM

## Instructions

You will be using your Web 1 final designs from your group project for this project. You will be creating 2 pages that link together. You will develop the group homepage as well as your individual page. Both pages will be developed by yourself. (Not a group project)

## Here is everything you will need to do

1. Create a new GitHub repo. Make sure it’s a public repo so that I have access to it.

You DO NOT have to use branches for this assignment.

1. Set up Codekit for a new project
2. Create all the .kit files you will need for this project
3. Validate your HTML files you should have 2. (index.html and the 2nd page.html)
4. Favicon is included
5. Google Fonts is included
6. Site is responsive

7. Develop your structure .scss files

8. Develop your content .scss files

9. Add your fonts, margins, padding, colors

10. Add the responsive navigation

Some things to keep in mind:

• Test on either actual devices or the iOS simulator.

• This project is as much about developing the project as it is about time management. Develop a plan early and do your best to stick to that plan.

• When something isn’t working, don’t just sit there. Get up and do something else. Go outside, play with your pet, or watch a movie. Come back to the project later and there is a good chance whatever was tripping you up before will be obvious for you to fix.

• Ask questions!
